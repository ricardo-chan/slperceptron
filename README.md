# slperceptron
Single layer perceptron implementation in python.

### What I learned:

* Simple implementation of perceptron using matplotlib as well as numpy libraries.
* Generating random points to use as test data
* Testing rate of convergence for the algorithm.

If the multiple iterations for the algorithm are used, it is recommended to comment out the line where the final epoch is plotted.

This code was based on [this project](https://github.com/bfaure/AI_Project_4/blob/master/Question_4/main.py).

Used as an exercise to further comprehend concepts seen in [Learning From Data Course](http://book.caltech.edu/bookforum/index.php).
